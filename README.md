# Microwth
The Microwth is a soilless indoor microgreen farm with build-in lighting and watering pump, the user interface provides an easy way to customize growing conditions to your liking.

The goal of this project is to create an open source platform to easily grow microgreens with a continuous harvesting cycle without too much intervention. To reach this goal I will test different lighting solutions, create multiple designs with different materials and optimize the growing cycle.

This repository hosts all hardware and software files of the platform, the current plastform runs standalone. In the future we would also like to connect the Microwth to the internet and develop a web application to manage the farms to notify the user about the grow conditions or tasks that are required.
